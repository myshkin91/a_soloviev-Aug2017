/* Write this concrete (non-abstract) class called TriangularPrism.  
 * It has 3 private fields (sideA, sideB, and sideC).
 * It inherits its height from its superclass, Prism (because all prisms have a height).
 * Provide a constructor and the methods required by its abstract superclass.  
 * 
 * Math Note:
 * Perimeter refers to the perimeter of the base - the sum of all the sides.
 * To find the area of a triangle given 3 side lengths, look up Heron's formula.  
 * It uses half the perimeter.  (Why might you want to use 0.5 instead of 1/2?)
